# Volunteer Computing Setup for Azure - 10 Minute Setup


---


As a Microsoft employee, you get a free Visual Studio Enterprise subscription for the rest of your life. This subscription includes a free $150/mo Azure services credit. In this document, we describe how to set up a virtual machine on Azure that will run [volunteer-computing projects](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/VolunteerComputing#:~:text=Volunteer%20computing%20is%20an%20arrangement,own%20Internet%2Dconnected%20personal%20computers), providing free computing resources to computation-intensive projects. Most of these projects advance research in biology, mathematics, astronomy, or medicine.


This setup will **avoid any charges beyond your $150 credit**.

Here's the gist of what you'll do:

* Create an Azure VM running Windows 10.
* Remote into the Azure VM.
* Install BOINC on the VM.
* Select some projects that you want to provide computation power for!
* Close session with your VM and let it run.
